Transformer language model written in pytorch and with the help of `firelab` library.

### TODO:
[ ] Sample from model with temperature (instead of taking max)
[ ] Sample from 70% of top words only
[ ] Beam search
[ ] Share layer weights in Transformer (to make it universal)
[ ] Is it normal, that we start with such high loss?
[ ] LR scheduling
